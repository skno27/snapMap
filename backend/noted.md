## Users

`/login` - POST

`/user` - GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE
:id parameter wont really be passed yet, since users wont have access to each other...
in the future, i think I can alter this so that users can friend one another and even share files. I will leave it simple for now.

`/user/chat` - GET, DELETE

`/user/collections` - GET, DELETE
